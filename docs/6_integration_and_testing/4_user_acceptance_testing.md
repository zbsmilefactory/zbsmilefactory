‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Performance acceptance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Final sign-off
```

## üìã **UAT Test Scenarios**

### **User Registration and Onboarding**
```gherkin
Feature: User Registration and Profile Setup
  As a new user
  I want to register and set up my profile
  So that I can access the platform features

Scenario: Successful Innovator Registration
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I fill in valid registration details:
    | Field        | Value                    |
    | First Name   | John                     |
    | Last Name    | Innovator               |
    | Email        | john@startup.com        |
    | Password     | SecurePass123!          |
    | Profile Type | Innovator               |
  And I agree to terms and conditions
  And I click "Register"
  Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
  And I should see a welcome message
  And I should receive a welcome email

Scenario: Profile Completion Flow
  Given I am logged in as a new innovator
  When I click "Complete Profile"
  Then I should see innovator-specific fields:
    | Field              | Required |
    | Startup Name       | No       |
    | Industry Focus     | Yes      |

  When I check my email inbox
  Then I should receive a verification email
  When I click the verification link
  Then my email should be marked as verified
  And I should be able to access all platform features
```

### **Community Interaction Testing**
```gherkin

  When I click "Comment"
  And I write a meaningful comment
  And I click "Submit Comment"
  Then my comment should appear under the post
  And the post author should receive a comment notification

Scenario: Profile Discovery and Connection
  Given I am on the Profiles tab
  When I search for "technology innovators"
  Then I should see relevant profiles
  When I click on a profile
  Then I should see their full profile information
  When I click "Connect"
  Then a connection request should be sent
  And the recipient should receive a notification
  When the recipient accepts the connection
  Then we should be connected
  And both users should see the connection in their network
```
