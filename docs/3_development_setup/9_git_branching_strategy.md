# Git Branching Strategy - SmileFactory Platform

## üå≥ **Branching Strategy Overview**

This document defines the comprehensive Git branching strategy for the SmileFactory platform development team, designed to support parallel development, quality assurance, and seamless deployment across multiple environments.

## üéØ **Strategy: Enhanced GitHub Flow with Environment Branches**

We use a modified GitHub Flow strategy optimized for team collaboration, continuous integration, and multi-environment deployment.

### **Core Principles**
- **Simple and Scalable**: Easy to understand and implement for teams of any size
- **JIRA Integration**: Branch names automatically link to JIRA issues
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in code review and testing requirements
- **Parallel Development**: Support for multiple features and teams
- **Safe Deployments**: Protected branches and automated testing

## üèóÔ∏è **Branch Structure**

### **Main Branches**

#### **1. `main` Branch** üè†
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Highest level protection
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to production
- **Merge Requirements**: 
  - Pull request required
  - 2+ approvals from CODEOWNERS
  - All CI checks must pass
  - Up-to-date with base branch

#### **2. `develop` Branch** üîß
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for ongoing development
- **Protection**: High level protection
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to staging environment
- **Merge Requirements**:
  - Pull request required
  - 1+ approval from team leads
  - All CI checks must pass

#### **3. `staging` Branch** üé≠
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and UAT
- **Protection**: Medium level protection
- **Deployment**: Deploys to staging environment for testing
- **Source**: Merged from `develop` when ready for testing

### **Feature Branches**

#### **Enhanced Branch Naming Convention**
```
{type}/{jira-key}-{phase-context}-{short-description}

Examples:
- feature/SMILE-123-P4-backend-user-authentication
- feature/SMILE-124-P5-frontend-user-profile-ui
- bugfix/SMILE-456-P5-frontend-dashboard-loading
- hotfix/SMILE-789-security-vulnerability
- epic/SMILE-15-P3-development-setup
```

#### **Phase Context Mapping**
- **P1**: Planning & Requirements (documentation/analysis)
- **P2**: Technical Architecture (design/specifications)
- **P3**: Development Setup (devops/infrastructure)
- **P4**: Backend Implementation (api/database/services)
- **P5**: Frontend Implementation (ui/components/state)
- **P6**: AI Integration (ai/ml/recommendations)
- **P7**: Integration & Testing (testing/qa/integration)
- **P8**: Deployment & Operations (deployment/monitoring)

#### **Branch Types**

**üöÄ Feature Branches** (`feature/`)
- **Purpose**: New features and enhancements
- **Source**: Created from `develop`
- **Target**: Merged back to `develop`
- **Lifespan**: Short-lived (1-2 weeks max)
- **Example**: `feature/SMILE-25-P6-ai-recommendations`

**üêõ Bugfix Branches** (`bugfix/`)
- **Purpose**: Non-critical bug fixes
- **Source**: Created from `develop`
- **Target**: Merged back to `develop`
- **Lifespan**: Short-lived (1-3 days)
- **Example**: `bugfix/SMILE-67-P5-frontend-profile-validation`

**üî• Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/`)
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Source**: Created from `main`
- **Target**: Merged to both `main` and `develop`
- **Lifespan**: Very short-lived (hours to 1 day)
- **Example**: `hotfix/SMILE-99-security-vulnerability`

**üìã Epic Branches** (`epic/`)
- **Purpose**: Large features spanning multiple stories (4+ weeks)
- **Source**: Created from `develop`
- **Target**: Merged back to `develop`
- **Lifespan**: Medium-lived (2-4 weeks)
- **Example**: `epic/SMILE-15-P3-development-setup`

**Enhanced Epic Branch Strategy** (for complex epics):
```
epic/SMILE-15-P3-development-setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/SMILE-25-P3-devops-docker-environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/SMILE-26-P3-devops-cicd-pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/SMILE-27-P3-devops-code-quality-gates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/SMILE-28-P3-devops-team-collaboration-tools
```

**Epic Branch Benefits**:
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers work on epic stories simultaneously
- **Integration Testing**: Test epic features together before merging to develop
- **Release Coordination**: Deploy entire epic as cohesive unit
- **Rollback Safety**: Easy to revert entire epic if issues arise

**üß™ Experimental Branches** (`experiment/`)
- **Purpose**: Proof of concepts and experiments
- **Source**: Created from `develop`
- **Target**: May be merged or discarded
- **Lifespan**: Variable
- **Example**: `experiment/SMILE-200-P6-new-ai-model`

## üìä **Team Guidelines**

### **Best Practices**

#### **Branch Management**
- Keep feature branches small and focused
- Delete merged branches promptly
- Regularly sync with develop branch
- Use descriptive branch names with JIRA keys

#### **Commit Guidelines**
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include JIRA key in commit messages
- Test before committing

#### **Collaboration**
- Communicate about long-running branches
- Coordinate on shared components
- Review PRs promptly (within 24 hours)
- Ask questions and provide constructive feedback

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# 1. Update your branch with latest develop
git checkout feature/SMILE-123-my-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop

# 2. Resolve conflicts in IDE
# 3. Test after resolution
# 4. Commit resolution
git add .
git commit -m "SMILE-123 Resolve merge conflicts with develop"
```

#### **Branch Cleanup**
```bash
# List merged branches
git branch --merged develop

# Delete local merged branches
git branch -d feature/SMILE-123-completed-feature

# Delete remote merged branches
git push origin --delete feature/SMILE-123-completed-feature
```

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### **Team Productivity Indicators**
- Average PR review time < 24 hours
- Merge conflicts < 5% of PRs
- Hotfix frequency < 1 per week
- Feature branch lifespan < 2 weeks
- CI/CD pipeline success rate > 95%
