## 🎯 **Overview**

This document consolidates all team workflow, code review processes, and development procedures for the SmileFactory Platform. It serves as the comprehensive guide for daily development activities and team collaboration.

## 🚀 **Daily Development Workflow**

### **🌅 Starting Your Day**
```bash
# 1. Check JIRA for assigned tickets
# 2. Pull latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/SMILE-XXX-P[4|5]-[component]-[description]

# 4. Start work and update JIRA
git commit --allow-empty -m "SMILE-XXX: Start [feature description] #in-progress"
git push origin feature/SMILE-XXX-P[4|5]-[component]-[description]
```

### **💻 During Development**
```bash
# Regular commits with JIRA reference
git add .
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: [What you did]"

# Log time in JIRA (optional)
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: [What you did] #time 2h"

# Push regularly
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### **🔄 Creating Pull Request**
1. **Push final changes**
2. **Go to GitHub** → Create Pull Request
3. **Use PR template** (auto-filled)
4. **Title format**: `SMILE-XXX [P4-Backend|P5-Frontend] Brief description`
5. **Request review** from team member
6. **Link JIRA ticket** in description

### **✅ Finishing Work**
```bash
# After PR is merged, JIRA ticket auto-transitions to Done
# Clean up local branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/SMILE-XXX-P[4|5]-[component]-[description]
```

## 🎯 **Role-Specific Workflows**

### **Frontend Developer Workflow**
**Focus Areas**:
- **Next.js Pages & Components**: App Router, Server Components, and layouts
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with strict mode
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for server state
- **API Integration**: Connecting to Node.js backend APIs
- **Performance**: SSR, SSG, and Core Web Vitals optimization
- **Testing**: Component and integration tests with Jest and Testing Library

**Branch Naming**:
```bash
feature/SMILE-XXX-P5-frontend-[description]

Examples:
✅ feature/SMILE-45-P5-frontend-user-dashboard
✅ feature/SMILE-67-P5-frontend-profile-components
✅ feature/SMILE-89-P5-frontend-community-feed
```

### **Backend Developer Workflow**
**Focus Areas**:
- **Node.js + Express.js**: REST API development and middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe queries
- **Authentication**: JWT and security middleware implementation
- **Business Logic**: Core platform functionality and microservices
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with Jest and Supertest

**Branch Naming**:
```bash
feature/SMILE-XXX-P4-backend-[description]

Examples:
✅ feature/SMILE-123-P4-backend-auth-api
✅ feature/SMILE-456-P4-backend-user-management
✅ feature/SMILE-789-P4-backend-community-endpoints
```

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Code Review Process**

### **Code Review Philosophy**
Our code review process ensures **modular architecture**, **scalability**, and **clear separation of concerns**. Every code change must demonstrate adherence to our architectural principles.

### **Review Priorities**
1. **Modularity Assessment**: Component independence and interface contracts
2. **Scalability Review**: Horizontal scaling and performance considerations
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers and services

### **Frontend Review Checklist**
- [ ] **Component Architecture**: Proper component composition and reusability
- [ ] **State Management**: Appropriate use of Zustand and TanStack Query
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimized rendering and bundle size
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- [ ] **Testing**: Component and integration tests with >85% coverage

### **Backend Review Checklist**
- [ ] **API Design**: RESTful principles with proper HTTP methods
- [ ] **Database Operations**: Efficient Prisma queries with error handling
- [ ] **Security**: Input validation, authentication, and authorization
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimized queries and caching strategy
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with >80% coverage

### **Review Process**
1. **Self-Review**: Author reviews code before requesting review
2. **Peer Review**: Team member conducts thorough review
3. **Architectural Review**: Senior developer validates architectural compliance
4. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline validates quality gates

## 📋 **JIRA Ticket Management**

### **Ticket States**
- **📋 To Do** → Ready for development
- **🔄 In Progress** → Currently being worked on
- **👀 In Review** → Pull request created, under review
- **🧪 Testing** → In QA testing
- **✅ Done** → Completed and merged

### **Updating Tickets**
```bash
# Start work
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: Start implementation #in-progress"

# Log time (optional)
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: Complete feature #time 4h"

# Move to review (when PR created)
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: Ready for review #in-review"

# Complete work (after merge)
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: Implementation complete #done"
```

## 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Update your branch with latest develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout your-branch
git merge develop

# Resolve conflicts in your IDE
# Then commit the merge
git add .
git commit -m "SMILE-XXX: Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```

### **JIRA Integration Issues**
- **Ticket Not Linking**: Ensure commit message starts with `SMILE-XXX:`
- **Status Not Updating**: Check GitHub-JIRA integration
- **PR Checks Failing**: Review GitHub Actions error messages

## 📞 **Getting Help and Escalation**

### **Technical Questions**
- **Frontend**: Ask frontend team lead or check frontend documentation
- **Backend**: Ask backend team lead or check backend documentation
- **General**: Create GitHub discussion or ask in team chat

### **Process Questions**
- **JIRA**: Check project management documentation
- **Git/GitHub**: Reference this guide or ask team lead
- **Workflow**: Reference team onboarding guide

### **Escalation Path**
1. **Team Member** → Ask colleague for immediate help
2. **Team Lead** → Technical guidance and architectural decisions
3. **Project Manager** → Process and priority questions
4. **Scrum Master** → Workflow and impediment resolution
