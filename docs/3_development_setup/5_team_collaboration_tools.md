  workflows:
    - "To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Code Review ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done"
    - "Backlog ‚Üí Selected for Development ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done"
```

### **Communication Platform**

## üìã **Development Workflow Tools**

### **Code Repository and Review**
**Tool**: GitHub Enterprise
**Features**:
- Source code management
- Pull request reviews
- Issue tracking
- Project boards
- Actions for CI/CD

**GitHub Configuration**:
```yaml
# .github/CODEOWNERS
# Global owners
* @tech-leads @senior-developers

# Backend code
/backend/ @backend-team @tech-leads

# Frontend code
/frontend/ @frontend-team @ui-ux-team

# Infrastructure
/helm/ @devops-team @tech-leads
/docker/ @devops-team

# Documentation
/docs/ @tech-leads @product-team
```

### **Code Quality and Analysis**
**Tools**:
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis
- **CodeClimate**: Technical debt tracking
- **Snyk**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting

**Integration Setup**:
```yaml
# sonar-project.properties
sonar.projectKey=zbinnovation-platform
sonar.organization=zbinnovation
sonar.sources=src/main
sonar.tests=src/test
sonar.java.coveragePlugin=jacoco
sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml

```

## üéØ **Agile Development Process**

### **Sprint Planning Process**
**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
**Sprint Ceremonies**:
```
Sprint Planning (4 hours):
- Review product backlog
- Estimate story points
- Commit to sprint goals
- Define acceptance criteria

Daily Standups (15 minutes):
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Any blockers or impediments?

Sprint Review (2 hours):
- Demo completed features
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Update product backlog

Sprint Retrospective (1 hour):
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint
```

### **Story Point Estimation**
**Fibonacci Scale**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
```
1 point: Simple configuration change
2 points: Small bug fix or minor feature
3 points: Medium feature with clear requirements
5 points: Complex feature requiring research
8 points: Large feature spanning multiple components
13 points: Epic-level work requiring breakdown
21 points: Too large, needs decomposition
```

### **Definition of Done**
```yaml
code_requirements:
  - Code written and reviewed
  - Unit tests written and passing
  - Integration tests passing
  - Code coverage meets threshold (80%)
  - No critical security vulnerabilities

documentation_requirements:
  - API documentation updated
  - User documentation updated
  - Code comments added where necessary
  - Architecture decisions documented

quality_requirements:
  - SonarQube quality gate passed
  - Performance requirements met
